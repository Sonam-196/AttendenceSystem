# Minimal dependencies for running the Streamlit app.
# Note: some packages (torch, insightface) are large and may increase deployment time.
streamlit
numpy
opencv-python-headless
Pillow

# Optional / likely required for your code
# insightface may require a specific torch version. If you have a working local env,
# run `pip freeze` locally and paste the exact versions here to avoid build issues.
insightface
torch
torchvision

# If you want to keep binaries out of git, they are already in .gitignore.

# To capture exact versions locally, run:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
